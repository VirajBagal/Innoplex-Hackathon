# Innoplex-Hackathon
Innoplex Hackathon was hosted on Analytics Vidhya website. It was NLP hackathon. I ranked 210th out of 3260 competitors. I have uploaded the photo of the final leaderboard. 

The dataset had three columns: text, drug(medicine) and sentiment. The 'text' column had texts of various people regarding the drug mentioned in the drug column. The task was to predict whether it was positive, neutral or negative sentiment.
